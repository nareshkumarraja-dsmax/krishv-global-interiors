                        <p class="policy-para">Lighting plays a crucial role in shaping the atmosphere and functionality of any room.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong class="policy-list">Living Room : </strong> Combine ambient lighting like recessed lights with task lighting like floor lamps in reading nooks and accent lighting to showcase artwork or a statement piece.</li>
                            <li><strong class="policy-list">Kitchen : </strong> Prioritize task lighting under cabinets and over the sink, and use ambient lighting to illuminate the entire space. Pendant lights over the island can add a touch of style.</li>
                            <li><strong class="policy-list">Bedroom : </strong> Opt for soft, layered lighting with a dimmer switch. Table lamps on nightstands provide task lighting for reading, while recessed lights can be used for ambient lighting.</li>
                        </ul>
